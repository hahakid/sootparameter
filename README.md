This is a modified labeling tool for the paper of "Quantifying the Fractal Dimension and Morphology of Individual Atmospheric Soot Aggregates".

1. "sootparameter.py" is the origional version.
2. A auto naming script (AutoNom.py) for uniforming the file name based on The Measuring Scale in each image is defined based on the microscope types.
3. The new "multi-labeler.py" supports multi-mask labeling in each image, and will generate a *.csv file for the circles in each masks each with corresponding mask file in png.

This can help accelerating the labeling speed. 

You can define more types of microscopes if you want.
